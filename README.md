## Mock Amazon App
*_A Node.js CLI application created with Inquirer and MySQL dependencies._*  
Using SQL backend to store a database of products, this app has two different modes for two distinct UIs.  
- As a customer (entry point [customer.js](https://github.com/pathak-neha/bamazon-app/blob/master/customer.js)), you can view and purchase products.
- As a manager (entry point [manager.js](https://github.com/pathak-neha/bamazon-app/blob/master/manager.js)), you can add a new product, add to current inventory, view a list of products with low inventory.

*_To view a demo of this app, where I used a very simple list of items in inventory (also stored in the seeds file) see [this video](https://github.com/pathak-neha/bamazon-app/blob/master/Levels_1_2.mp4)._*
