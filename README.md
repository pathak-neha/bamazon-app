# Mock Amazon App
***A Node.js CLI application that relies on Inquirer and MySQL.***

A basic app that contains a database of products, and mutliple users.

- As a customer (entry point [customer.js](https://github.com/pathak-neha/bamazon-app/blob/master/customer.js)), you can view and purchase products.
- As a manager (entry point [manager.js](https://github.com/pathak-neha/bamazon-app/blob/master/manager.js)), you can add a new product, add to current inventory, view a list of products with low inventory.

## To view a demo of this app, see [this video](https://github.com/pathak-neha/bamazon-app/blob/master/Levels_1_2.mp4).
